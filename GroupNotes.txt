Tableau Filters:
1. Heat Map: 
    - Used tablea_clean.csv
    - Converted 'F1' to Discrete Dimension with Zip Code Geographic Role. Renamed to 'Zip Codes'
    - Columns: Longitude, Rows: Latitude
    - Map style
    - Filters: Measure Names: 2017-01-31 (can use any date we want to select)
    - Marks: Measure Values: Color, Zip Codes: Size, Measure Names: Detail
    - Measured Values: Sum(2017-01-31)
        -   Colors used: Red-Green-Gold Diverging
2. Linear Regression Model
    - Used clean_data.csv
    - Mocked up three zip codes as example
    - Columns: Date as a Discrete Dimension
    - Rows: Zip Codes as a Continuous Dimension with Zip Code Geographic Role
        - Note: I had to convert zip codes individually, so we might consider how we do this in mass, if needed
    - Used Line chart
    - Added a Trend Line in Analytics Tab
        - In Trend Line Options, used a linear model type. Left other settings as is

Week 4: 

Outline:

Broad Questions:

- Do major events predict housing market?
- Can we predict market over time using linear regression?
- Use R rating to measure overall confidence level
- Read overall trends to predict appreciation or depreciation
	- Use linear regression model - utilize zip code and/or state and date
		○ Zip code is core data - what we want to analyze by
	- Drop zip codes with an accuracy level of under 75%
	- Using Region Name (zip code) run it through a linear regression and output the predicted data for price trend
    - store slope value and intercept of graph for output Website
	
User Output: User must input a zip code and a date to forecast price (y-value)
	- date input must be future date (at least one year?)
	
Questions to consider in visualization:

    - How to make the data tell a story
	
Dashboard/Website ideas: 
 - Heatmap? 
 - Click map and pop up? 
 - Export charts?
 - 	Need HTML: y=mx + b calculation. To bypass datetime conversion. Read different types of datetime entries
- Map of texas with slider?
- Heat maps with specific point in time for all zip codes
- Compare zip codes with price over time - add a line of inflation
	

Barriers: 
    - How to save each output under a name that we can call back. How to store x/y slope values
	
Questions for Presentation (9/28)	
✓ Selected topic - We are using historical residential real estate data to explore trends in sales prices by date and zip code in Texas and to predict future sales prices. 
✓ Reason why they selected their topic ✓ Description of their source of data - Zillow provides sales historical sales data for non-commercial use. Nathan did some research on various APIs that we could explore. 
    We wanted to pick a topic/data source that we had some knowledge in so that we were able to gut check the analysis against practical application. I also have a background in real estate, so am able to act as a 
    subject matter expert for the group as we go through our analysis. 
✓ Questions they hope to answer with the data - Though our big picture questions have shifted and evolved during our data exploration phase, we are hoping to use the data to understand sales trends within specific regions. 
    Additionally, the initial data shows statistically significant spikes outside the trend line of our model, which, we are hypothesizing indicates specific historical moments that created a significant impact on the 
    fair market value and sales prices. We want to analyze this to see how these events impact our overall future predictions and potentially if these spikes show similar patterns. 
✓ Description of the data exploration phase of the project - Within our exploration, it became evident that we would want to use a linear regression model to calculate future trends. We also found that are data set 
    included multiple states and gaps in sales price data, so part of our data exploration was assessing how narrow or broad we wanted the scope of our analysis to be. We decided that the model was ultimately more 
    accurate and useful if it was narrowed specifically to Texas zip codes.
✓ Description of the analysis phase of the project
	We have finalized our linear regression model. In our output phase, we hope to provide a user interface where they can input a zip code and future date and be provided with a prediction of price values in that region. 
    This caused an obstacle in our model since we have so many zip codes and essentially need to perform individual regression models on each zip code. To solve for this, we created a for loop that stores the output for 
    each zip code. We'll then use this dataframe to output data for our user interface.
