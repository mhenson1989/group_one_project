# Group_1_Final_Project

## **Project Outline**

**1. Broad Questions**
    - *Can we use machine learning to predict whether or not a residential property in a specific zip code is either appreciating or depreciating on a given date in the future?*
    - *Can we compare this property to other properties within the same state and assess a ranking of property values, based on the selected date?*

**2. Technologies & Data Used** 
    - Linear Regression: We will use a linear regression model to implement our predictive machine learning, specifically using zip code, state and date data points, with zip code data being our core data (that which we will want to analyze by). 
        - Accuracy percentage output could be use as a confidence rating
        - Based on initial results, we will drop zip codes with an accuracy percentage that is lower than the average accuracy percentage. 
    - Zillow offers a large collection of data points, related to housing prices, by zip code, by state, and over time. We plan to compile and clean this data into a DataFrame. 
    - Visualization: 
        - Predictive Model: Users will be able to access a website, pick a zip code and future date. The website will output results upon clicking an analyze button. 
        - Final Presentation: Format TBD
